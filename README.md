## Nationality Detection
Detecting age,nationality and emotion of a person by uploading images
## To run the model
1. clone this repository
2. Run the [GUI.py](https://github.com/Vasantharish/Nationality_detection/blob/8fca2eadf6888295abcf3b1d7b29564a09cdcec5/GUI.py)file
3. with options you can select images to test by choosing file or select custom images
4. click show selected button if you're selected custom images

## To run notebook
1. clone this repository
2. This project contains two notebooks one for age, ethencity classification another for Emotion classification.
3. For age, ethencity classification download [UTK_dataset](https://github.com/Vasantharish/long_hair_detection/tree/3a252e9e7fb34a67f6002e1b4c278b56b2716d1b/UTKFace)dataset.
4. For emotion classification download [train](https://github.com/Vasantharish/Nationality_detection/tree/8fca2eadf6888295abcf3b1d7b29564a09cdcec5/train),[test](https://github.com/Vasantharish/Nationality_detection/tree/8fca2eadf6888295abcf3b1d7b29564a09cdcec5/test) dataset.
5. Run two notebooks[ethencity.ipynb](https://github.com/Vasantharish/Nationality_detection/blob/8fca2eadf6888295abcf3b1d7b29564a09cdcec5/ethencity.ipynb) [expression.ipynb](https://github.com/Vasantharish/Nationality_detection/blob/8fca2eadf6888295abcf3b1d7b29564a09cdcec5/expression.ipynb) one after another after downloading above mentioned datasets
6. To get two models which used for predicting images
